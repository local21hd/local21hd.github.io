    "text": "What is bargaining?\nBargaining is when we (Local 21HD) negotiate with the County to set our pay, benefits, and working conditions. For Local21HD, bargaining occurs in two phases: (1) bargaining between the Coalition of Unions and King County, and (2) Local 21HD “small table” bargaining.\n\nCoalition of Unions and King County Bargaining\nLocal 21HD joins with many other unions that represent King County staff to jointly bargain with King County. The Coalition Labor Agreement generally covers the “big” ticket items like Cost of Living Increases (also know as General Wage Increases), leave (e.g. vacation), health benefits (kind of), and other benefits (e.g. paid parental leave, professional development, child care). It is the result of this process to which the Local 21HD specific issues/negotiations are append.\nThese bargaining sessions are mostly carried out by the Coalition Co-Chairs (e.g. staff representatives and each member of the coalition sends a member or two to participate (usually the President or designee). By joining with other unions, we generate strength through numbers.\n\n\nLocal 21HD “small table” Bargaining\nWe (Local 21HD) bargain with the County on a number of specific topics. The Local 21HD bargaining is guided by our staff representative and generally includes at least one member from each job classification. Relevant topics include:\n\nHigher pay ranges\nTriggering bureaucratic reviews (e.g. determining the need to update our job classifications)\nComp time and over time rules\nLayoff language\nBilingual premium\n\nThe current status of all of these topics Local21HD Specific Agreement/Appendix.\n\n\n\nWhen is bargaining?\nOur contracts conclude at the end of 2024. We expect Coalition bargaining will begin in late spring/early summer with small table bargaining to follow. Ideally, everything is nice and done by the end of 2024. However, the last cycle didn’t complete until 2022 (after starting in 2020/2021).\n\n\nHow will Local21HD faithfully represent its members\nAt a minimum, we will conduct a survey of members to gauge priorities. We hope to supplement this survey with focus groups, drop-in sessions, and other approaches to make sure we have the best data/information available. We also hope to form an active and diverse bargaining committee to advocate for the will of L21HD members. We will scale up our preparation in late March/early April 2024."
